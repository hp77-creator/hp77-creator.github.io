## Overview

This book is a comprehensive guide to building data-intensive applications. It covers fundamental concepts and trade-offs in distributed systems.

## Key Takeaways

### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

- **Reliability**: System should work correctly even when things go wrong (hardware faults, software faults, human errors)
- **Scalability**: As system grows (data volume, traffic, complexity), there should be reasonable ways to deal with that growth
- **Maintainability**: Over time, many different people will work on the system, and they should all be able to work on it productively

### Data Models

The book explores different data models:
- Relational databases
- Document databases (NoSQL)
- Graph databases

Each has its own strengths and use cases.

## Personal Notes

This book provides excellent mental models for thinking about distributed systems. The author does a great job of explaining complex concepts with clear examples and diagrams.

Currently working through the chapters on replication and partitioning - fascinating stuff about consistency models and consensus algorithms.
