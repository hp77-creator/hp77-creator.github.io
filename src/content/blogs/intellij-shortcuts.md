IntelliJ is one of my favorite IDE's for Java. I work in a company where most of our codebase is in Java for Backend. We use
IntelliJ as our IDE. It is really powerful and has some awesome shortcuts that I think one can add in their arsenal, below I am 
sharing couple of which I like a lot

- `Shift + Shift` for Search Anywhere feature. This allows you to search anything in your project, be it in text, code or anywhere
- `Cmd + Shift + A` for `Find Action`. If you want to do some Action like `Run Test`, `Open Terminal` or any other refactoring task, this command is handy
- `Cmd + E` for checking out the `Recent Files` and accessing them without going over the project window
- `Cmd + Shift + E` for switching between different locations of your `Recent Files`
- `Ctrl + Tab` for directly switching between different files

I like `Vim` keybindings so I have enabled that for my IDE and I navigate java files using that, I really like the comfort of home row key navigation.

You can also use `Zen Mode` by pressing 'Ctrl + \`' and then Selecting `5. View Mode` and selecting `Zen Mode` out of it.

When you are in Zen Mode, you can use all the above shortcut to search for things without distraction and have things at your fingertip.
