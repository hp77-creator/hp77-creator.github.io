  <div class="space-y-5"><p>I have been a Google Summer of Code contributor at <a class="link" href="https://eunomia.dev/">eunomia-bpf</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I have done B.Tech from <a class="link" href="https://www.svnit.ac.in/">SVNIT </a>.
      I got interested in computers when I was goofing around with my cousins and they were talking about Bill Gates, Steve Jobs.
      I was learning about different things related to computers. Then in school I had a computer course where I learnt about <a class="link" href="https://qb64.com/">QBasic </a>.
      I along with my friends started looking out on resources to create a snake game in QBasic. Then in high school, I started learning about 
      html, css and javascript. I came across <a class="link" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a> and their extensive curriculum on web development. I started learning about 
      it and with a Dell inspiron 15 3000 with 4th gen intel chip, I started surfing internet for how can I create stuff. I recall I had also started learning python from the
      official documentation. I have not been able to complete it and it makes no sense to complete it as it is a documentation not a learning journal. </p>

      <p>I came across Google Code-in and I learnt about open source contribution. That began my journey of open source contribution and curiosity to explore 
      more on the emerging technologies of the world. I learnt <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Computer-Science-Class-12-Examination/dp/8177000241">C++</a> in my 11-12th grade and then in college, I started learning about Machine learning.
      I created couple of projects in ML with a technical club of my college. </p>
      <p>After graduating from college, I started exploring more on systems and how 
      Operating systems, languages and compilers work. I came across Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces(It is free to read <a class="link" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">here</a>) book and read it cover to cover. I loved every bit of it.
      I started attending meetups in my city, heard about eBPF and that <a class="link" href="https://speakerdeck.com/madhavjivrajani/can-we-use-ebpf-to-debug-performance-of-the-go-scheduler">eBPF talk</a> by Madhav Jivrajani and Raghav remained ingrained in my mind. 
      Then there came a documentary on youtube about <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/Wb_vD3XZYOA?si=taGvQCXNvSsoVGk0">eBPF </a> I watched it and I was amazed to learn of its beginnings. So when GSoC&#39;24 came,
      I looked for projects on eBPF and I found <a class="link" href="https://eunomia.dev/">eunomia-bpf</a>. I was amazed to see that they had created a 
      userpace runtime for eBPF which is by nature a kernel space technology. I got into the project and I am still contributing to it. 
      These days, I am learning more on distributed systems, doing some projects on codecrafters.io and looking for an opportunity to work in a more system oriented role.
