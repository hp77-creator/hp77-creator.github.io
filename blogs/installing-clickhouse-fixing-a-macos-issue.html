documentation on their site for this purpose.
I referred to it but I was facing an issue whenever I was doing</p>
<pre><code>cmake --build build
</code></pre>
<p>Error was something that <code>strchrnul</code> is redefined, previously it was defined in <code>MacOSX15.4</code> system libraries and then it was again 
defined in some postgres header file, I checked github to find out if there is any open issue on this. I found one issue but it was closed:
<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78804" class="link">https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78804</a></p>
<p>In the issue comments it was mentioned that clang version is not supported, maybe because the author had specifically mentioned 
<code>clang 17.0.0</code> and <code>Clickhouse</code> only works on <code>clang 19</code> and that too non-apple one.
Our errors were similar though, so that prompted me to look up more on this issue and I got to know from a LLM that there is
a issue discovered in Postgres on this: 
<a rel="external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/407464.1743535559%2540sss.pgh.pa.us#277a94029172f7d3de0048d46474ebf0" class="link">https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/407464.1743535559%40sss.pgh.pa.us#277a94029172f7d3de0048d46474ebf0</a></p>
<p>I checked the <code>cmake</code> file for <code>Postgres</code> and there was already a check regarding this. I wondered why then my build was failing.</p>
<p>I ran the command which was checking the version for my system, it was <code>xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-version</code>. This command was returning me <code>15.2</code> but I checked in my error logs, library version which was being used was <code>15.4</code>. </p>
<p>Because <code>xcrun</code> was returning a lower version, the cmake check was failing and <code>strchrnul</code> was also included, it wouldn‚Äôt have failed
if we were getting <code>15.4</code>. </p>
<p>I changed the way version was checked and re-ran the build commands, voila it worked.</p>
<p>I submitted my PR: <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80228/files" class="link">https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80228/files</a></p>
<p>It was interesting to know that how much an OS can change the stability of a system. MacOSX didn‚Äôt come with their own <code>strchrnul</code> but in latest versions they are defining a constant for that.</p>
<p>Postgres had it declared when they were creating their software and now their changes were breaking. It was a nice reminder that unless you own everything in the stack, you can‚Äôt be sure when and where your software can break.</p>
